    <p>Loot. Before anything, you must pick up weapons and items that will help you heal. It is best to pickup weapons first incase people try and fight you right off the bat. There are many different weapons to choose from. Be sure to pickup shields which will increase your health bar. </p>
  </li>
  <li id="step2">
    <h2></h2>
    <img src="images/gather materials.jpg" alt="">
    <p>Get Materials. There is wood, stone, and metal. Wood is the easiest to get, as there are trees everywhere in fortnite. Stone and metal build slower but are stronger. You want to get materials so that you can build to protect yourself from opponents. </p>
  </li>
  <li id="step3">
    <h2></h2>
    <img src="images/search.png" alt="">
    <p>Search for opponents.When you are close to an enemy, you can hear them. Be ready to shoot and build. </p>
  </li>
  <li id="step4">
    <h2></h2>
    <img src="images/build battle.jpg" alt="">
    <p>Build! When an enemy attacks you, if they get the first shot on you, you want to build a wall, typically followed by a staircase. Building up multiple stories high can help you get a height advantage on your opponent. It also makes it harder for enemies to shoot you. Building takes a lot of practice, but once you figure it out, it can be one of the most fun parts of the game. There are often "build battles," where you and the enemy are both building higher and higher into the sky.</p>
  </li>
  <li id="step5">
    <h2></h2>
    <img src="images/shoot.jpg" alt="">
    <p>lastly, shoot. You need to learn how to aim. You can change your sensitivity in the settings. This can help you find the right speed for aiming. Aim for the head to kill the enemy quicker. After killing the last enemy in the game, you win!</p>
