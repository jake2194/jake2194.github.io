Seurat's A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte was painted in 1884. The artist worked with color, light, and form. I had never seen a pointilist painting before. If you look at the painting up close, you see thousands of dots, but as you look at it from further away, the shapes of the people begin to emerge. I particularly like this painting because of the effect you get from the dots. I also like the sharp edges around the figures in the painting, the colors and the scenery.
