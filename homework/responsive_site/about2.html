This is Rodin's most famous work. I actually got to this sculpture in person at the Mus√©e Rodin in Paris. This was cast in 1904. It was originally conceived as part of his larger work The Gates of Hell. I like this sculpture because the man looks as if he is lost in thought. He looks heroic. There is something beautiful about it. You wonder what he is thinking about. When Rodin described this work, he said "What makes my Thinker think is that he thinks not only with his brain, with his knitted brow, his distended nostrils and compressed lips, but with every muscle of his arms, back, and legs, with his clenched fist and gripping toes."
