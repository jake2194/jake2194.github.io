What's interesting about this painting is that Van Gogh painted this in 1889 while in an asylum. He suffered from paranoia and hallucinating. He painted this completely from his imagination, unlike most impressionist paintings. Here are are the things I like about this painting. I like the swirls of paint and the brush strokes in the sky. I like the different shades of blue from light to dark. I like how he made the stars yellow and orange.
